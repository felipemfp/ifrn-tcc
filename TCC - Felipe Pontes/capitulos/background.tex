\section{GeoGuide}

GeoGuide is an awesome solution for exploring spatial data...

GeoGuide is about making easy to the researcher explore, visualize and learn with spatial datasets.
In order to accomplish a better user experience, we provide a guidence approach based
on his preferences and explicit feedback.
GeoGuide continuously improves its guidance algorithm while
researcher is exploring the dataset. The framework captures implicit feedback
and try to understand what the user wants by analysing how the
researcher preferences has evolved over time.
