George is a software engineer with a very good taste for food. He likes to go to restaurants every month. George likes to try new restaurants and he already knows almost every place in his city, Parnamirim. So now George is looking for places in the nearby city, Natal. Before GeoGuide, George founds himself losing a lot of time choosing restaurant instead of actually going to them. And George changes his preferences with the seasons: another challenge for him during the Yelp exploration. For example, in the winter George prefers places close to his home or his work and in the summer, he prefers places which offers sea food.

By using GeoGuide during the past year to get to know almost every place in his city, when George starts to looking for places in the nearby city, GeoGuide already understands the behavior of George's preferences over the seasons and highlight suggestions of places most likelly to be interesting for him according to moment of the year.
